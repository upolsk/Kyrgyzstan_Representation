    <section>
        <h2 class="intr">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><i>"Kyrgyz"</b></i>  is believed to have been derived from the Turkic word for "forty", about 
            the forty clans of Manas, a legendary hero who united forty regional clans against 
            the Uyghurs. Literally, Kyrgyz means We are forty. "-stan" is a word in the Persian
            language meaning "place of" or "country".</h2>

            <p class="h2-left">&nbsp; &nbsp; The flag of the Kyrgyz Republic consists of a red field charged with a yellow sun that 
            contains a depiction of a tunduk, the opening in the center of the roof of a yurt 
            (traditional tent). It is actually a depiction of the first thing one sees when waking up 
            in a yurt, namely the construction of the pinnacle of every Kyrgyz yurt with three crisscrossing laths 
            across the circular opening at the top of the yurt. Adopted in 1992, just over seven months after the
            country's independence was declared, to replace the flag of the Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic(SSR), 
            it has been the flag of the Kyrgyz Republic since that year. The red on the flag is said to be 
            inspired by the pennant lifted by Manas, the country's folk hero.</p>

                <p class = "h2-left">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Kyrgyzstan’s great distance from the oceans and the sharp change of elevation 
                from adjacent plains strongly influence the country’s climate. Deserts and plains 
                surround Kyrgyzstan on the north, west, and southeast, making the contrast with 
                the climate and landscape of its mountainous interior all the more striking. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
                lower parts of its fringing ranges lie in belts of high temperature and receive hot, 
                drying winds from the deserts beyond. The amount of precipitation the country’s 
                westward and northward-facing slopes receive increases with their height.<br>
                The valleys have hot dry summers, with a mean July temperature of 28 °C. 
                In January the average temperature is −18 °C. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annual precipitation varies 
                from 7 inches (180 mm) in the eastern Tien Shan to 30 to 40 inches (760 to 1,000 
                mm) in the Kyrgyz and Fergana ranges. In the most populous valleys, rainfall 
                ranges from 4 to 20 inches (100 to 500 mm) a year.  </p>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kyrgyz is a Turkic language of the Kipchak branch spoken in Central Asia. It is the official language of 
            Kyrgyzstan and a significant minority language in the Kizilsu Kyrgyz Autonomous Prefecture in Xinjiang, 
            China and in the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region of Tajikistan. 
            <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a very high level of mutual intelligibility between Kyrgyz, Kazakh, and Altay.
            Kirghiz is a Common Turkic language belonging to the Kipchak branch of the family. It is considered to be an 
            East Kipchak language, forming a subfamily with the Southern Altai language within the greater Kipchak branch. 
            Internally, Kirghiz has three distinct varieties; Northern and Southern Kirghiz.
            <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kyrgyz shares similarities with various sub branches of Common Turkic such as Kipchak, Karluk (due to 
            Chaghatai Turkic and language convergence) and the Siberian sub branch (due to the Yenisei Kyrgyz ancestry). 
            Kazakh and Kyrgyz are mutually intelligible and differ mainly phonetically, while the grammar is much the same. 
            Until the 20th century, both languages used a common written form of Chaghatai Turkic.
            <br><br>
            Kyrgyzstan is a member of Soviet republics in Central Asia to have Russian as an official language.
