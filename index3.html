</figure> 
    <p class="h2-right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This grand, rugged but very 
accessible gorge is situated 
about an hour's drive south of 
Bishkek. Now converted into a 
national park, it offers scores of 
walking and trekking 
possibilities, including hikes to 
glaciers and for serious 
mountaineers, climbs to some of 
the region's highest peaks.
<br><br>In the Kyrgyz language, Ala-Archa means bright juniper and it grows in abundance 
over the mountain slopes. The Alamedin River, flowing along the gorge is 
beautiful but treacherous.<br><br>Ala-Archa national park is a favourite place with the 
citizens of Bishkek, who like to relax by a waterfall and enjoy a picnic in the 
summer. Experienced hikers can climb up to the stunning Ak Say Canyon and Ak 
Say Glacier.

    <a target="_blank" href="images/burana.jpg"><img id="evenA" src="images/burana.jpg" style="width:31.25em; height:18.75em;" alt="Burana Tower"></a>
    <p class="h2-right"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Burana Tower is large minaret in the Chuy Valley in northern Kyrgyzstan. It is located about 80 km east of the country's capital Bishkek, near the town of Tokmok. 
    The tower, along with grave markers, some earthworks and the remnants of a castle and three mausoleums, 
    is all that remains of the ancient city of Balasagun, which was established by the Karakhanids at the end of the 9th century. 
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tower was built in the 11th century and was used as a template for other minarets. 
    An external staircase and steep, winding stairway inside the tower enables visitors to climb to the top. 
    It is one of the oldest architectural constructions in Central Asia.

    <h1 class="h1a">Lake Isyk-Kol</h1>
    <a target="_blank" href="images/ysyk.jpg"><img id="oddA" src="images/ysyk.jpg" style="width:31.25em; height:18.75em;" alt="Lake Ysyk-Kol"></a>
    <p class="h2-right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lake Isyk Kol 
        meaning <strong>"warm lake" </strong>
        is the second largest 
        mountain lake in the 
        world. Measuring 
        182km long by 58km 
        wide, the lake is 
        heated from below by 
        thermal activity and 
        never freezes even in 
        the depths of winter.
        <br><br>In the summer the 
        water temperature reaches 25-28 degrees centigrade (warmer than the air) and you 
        can swim in the clear blue waters enclosed on all sides by the snowy peaks of the 
        Tien Shan Mountains.
        <br><br> Most of the resorts are on the north shore of the lake and the 
        area between here and Almaty in Kazakhstan is excellent trekking territory.
        <br><br>

    <p class="h2-right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheltering in the lee of a black granite cliff, in what must surely be one of the 
prettiest valleys in the country, this ancient Silk Road caravanserai, constructed of 
dark stone with a huge arched entrance, domed roof and corner turrets, appears 
like some ancient eastern castle, a mythical outpost from some long-forgotten 
legend.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Before it, sweeping out of 
sight behind a sheer ridge is 
a wide green valley, dotted 
with yurts and hundreds of 
animals: horses, cattle, yaks 
and sheep. <br> With a friendly 
family to stay with in cozy, 
well-equipped yurts, 
wonderful walks and rides 
in the mountains passes, a 
visit to Tash Rabat is one of 
the highlights of any trip to Kyrgyzstan.</p>

<p class="h2-right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Skazka Canyon is 
nicknamed <strong>“Fairytale
Canyon”</strong> because of its 
irregular rock formations 
that resemble animals, 
fantastical characters and 
castles. 
<br><br>Not only the 
shapes in this canyon are 
remarkable, but also the 
colors of the rocks are very 
unique.
<br><br>

very colorful painting.

<p class="h2-right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jeti Oguz is yet another 
    example of how Kyrgyzstan 
    looks so much like the 
    Western American 
    landscape. <br><br>Meaning <strong>“seven 
    bulls”</strong>in Kyrgyz, Jeti Oguz is 
    a collection of blood-red 
    rocks at the base of the 
    Ala-Too Mountains. <br><br>Their 
    prominent shape, height, 
    and absolutely brilliant 
    color, which is wonderfully 
    juxtaposed against the 
    green hills, make them 
    unforgettable.<br><br>Click to learn more:<br> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeti-%C3%96g%C3%BCz_District" target="blank"><u>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeti-%C3%96g%C3%BCz_District</u></a></p>

<p class="h2-right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arslanbab is most well-known for hosting the largest walnut forest in the world. 
<br><br> This forest is a great source of pride for the natives and it is a pretty big part of 
    their life.
<br><br>In the autumn, 
    almost everyone runs 
    away into the forest to 
    pick walnuts and during 
    this time there are lots of 
    harvest celebrations.

    places to do it.</p>
